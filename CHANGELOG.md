### Enhancements

- **Miniconda 3:**
    - We have build our own Miniconda 3 (based on Python 3.7) image. The reason
    for that image is, that the original Miniconda 3 images uses Debian 9.x
    (codename stretch). The repos for texlive are from the year 2016. We changed
    to Debian 10 (codename Buster). The  texlive packages are from 2019.
